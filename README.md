# Initial idea:

This website represents a solution to a very common issue in the world, women's lack of representation. Its goal is to represent important women in tech, past and present, and to enable communication between them and women in tech so that the gap can be bridged.

This is done by creating a portal-type site where members can see the mentors, their achievements and where they work. Through this the user can log in as a mentor or user, and users can book an appointment and send a message to the mentor.

# Group Task

You are in mixed-level groups with different experiences and expertise to combine your skills to achieve the task.

Roles to consider within the group:

-   Those with artistic flair and creativity who can design the initial concept of the website using canvas tools. They will lay the visual foundation for the project.

-   Those proficient in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript who will implement the designs created. They will focus on building static web pages and ensuring cross-device compatibility.

-   'Experienced' coders with full-stack knowledge who will add dynamic features, such as user authentication and backend logic, to make the website interactive and engaging. They will integrate these features into the project.
